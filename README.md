# Overview of the statistical analysis
The purpose of this project is to create a Tableau Story to convice potential investors that bike-sharing in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The story will contain information such as: Tripduration for all rides and genders, the number of trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week for all riders and genders, and finally, what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by user type and gender.

We also made an additional change to the dataset in order for tripduration column to contain a datetime datatype. The code for changing the tripduration data type is located in the NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb file.
