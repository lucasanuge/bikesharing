# Overview of the statistical analysis
The purpose of this project is to create a Tableau Story to convice potential investors that bike-sharing in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The story will contain information such as: Tripduration for all rides and genders, the number of trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week for all riders and genders, and finally, what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by user type and gender.

We also made an additional change to the dataset in order for tripduration column to contain a datetime datatype. The code for changing the tripduration data type is located in the NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb file.

# Summary
The results of the analysis shows that most users are active using citibike during after work hours and further analysis also shows that the majority citibike users only use our services for around 5 minutes at a time. We can also see that a mojority of our clients are male, second are females, and lastly others. Another observation is that from the graph that shows the number of bike riders during different times of the day, we can see that most acivity occur during 'going to work' and 'going home' hours. And lastly, from our last graph, we can see that male subscribers of the citibike service are the most active among all groups.
